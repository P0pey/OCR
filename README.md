Second year student's project.

* NeuralNetwork:
    contain file for build a neural network.
    contain a xor file too.
    We can save and load training from neural network.
        Usage : make xor
               "> ./xor" for training
               "> ./xor n" for n training
               make ocr
               "> ./ocr" for train 1000 times neural network
               "> ./ocr path_to_image" to compute network with image

* Segmentation:
    contain file for cut an image in bloc, line and character.
    coutain file for applying grayscale and binarization.
        Usage : make grayscale
                "> ./grayscale path_to_image" to show the process
                make segmentation
                "> ./segmentation path_to_image" to show the process
